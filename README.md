    2025 Â· Data Science Challenge (CGU)

    Developed a robust API using FastAPI with three endpoints focused on document question answering (RAG), PDF embedding, and sentiment classification. The architecture is designed for scalability, high performance, and LLM integration.

    Key goals:
      - Upload and process PDFs to extract embeddings and store them in a vector database
      - Enable RAG-based answers to user questions using local LLMs
      - Implement sentiment classification using logprobs from open-source language models
      - Deploy scalable API architecture using FastAPI, Queues, Kubernetes and Workers

    Architecture Highlights:
      - API Gateway with OAuth2, JWT, HTTPS encryption and rate limiting
      - Asynchronous task queue with specialized GPU workers for LLM inference
      - RAG with LangChain + Llama 3.1 via Ollama, using MiniLM for embeddings
      - Vector database: ChromaDB
      - Chunking strategy: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

- LLM - Spiritism Chat

  2024 Â· Personal Project
  
  Built a conversational AI to discuss and explore the Spiritist doctrine, based on the works of Allan Kardec. The system uses Python and LangChain, loading Kardec's texts to provide contextual, doctrine-based responses.
  
  An API was also developed to integrate the model with a web interface (Streamlit), enabling real-time interactions.

- A tool for analyzing patterns in hashtags on Twitter

  Feb 2016 Â· Academic Project Â· Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro

  Developed a data mining tool to identify patterns in Twitter hashtags, addressing the lack of analytical tools for large-scale social media data. The system extracts, processes, and visualizes insights using custom workflows.

  In a case study with hashtags #foraDilma and #foraCunha, the tool revealed political associations and public sentiment patterns during Brazilâ€™s 2016 political crisis.
