### Projects:

- LLM - Spiritism Chat
  
It's a project to chat about Spiritism and learn a few more about the doctrine.
It's created using Python and Langchain, where it's loaded Allan Kardec's books to make a context for the model.
Besides that, It has an API to connect the webpage and the model.
