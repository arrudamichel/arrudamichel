### Michel Arruda - Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer

#### I am a computer scientist who loves to study and work with data.

- I'm data scientist.
- I'm a Master of Computer and Software Engineer on COPPE/UFRJ
- I'm Graduate Computer Scientist on UFRRJ

### Projects:

- LLM - Spiritism Chat
  
It's a project to chat about Spiritism and learn a few more about the doctrine.
It's created using Python and Langchain, where it's loaded Allan Kardec's books to make a context for the model.
Besides that, It has an API to connect the webpage and the model.
